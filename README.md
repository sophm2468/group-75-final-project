# Story Pitch
The story we intend to visualize is the perceived relationship, and the actual relationship, between population density and air quality in the United States. We want to examine the differences between urban and rural areas. This project will use data from various sources, including federal databases, academic studies, and crowdsourced data. The end goal of this project is to explain and visualize how air quality varies across different levels of population density. Using this data, we want to get a more detailed picture of what we can infer from an area having poor air quality, and how that, in conjunction with the density of a region, affects the health and well-being of residents. 

At first glance this seems like an easy question to answer; the denser the area, the greater the emissions output, however, we want to test if that is actually the case. It would be interesting, and eye opening, to see what the nuances are when considering population and carbon emissions. How does an agricultural hub affect carbon emissions vs a metropolitan hub? 

Although carbon emissions are just one facet of climate change, they are indicators of a larger issue. Greenhouse gasses exist all over the world, and they have had proven, negative, effects on our planet. They act as an oven, trapping heat in our atmosphere, and heating up the planet to potentially disastrous temperatures. Greenhouse gasses include the following: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and Fluorinated Gasses. Our data set focuses on the CO2 concentration, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtco2e). 

We hope to cross reference data-based maps of population density, and CO2 concentration to study the overlaps between the two. These overlaps can then offer us a foundation for further research, and make further distinctions about carbon emissions as they relate to societal distributions. While regular people are being blamed, told to be conscious of their own carbon footprint, or told to shop at “carbon neutral” stores, it is not everyday individuals who are the core of the problem. By visualizing these data sets in a way that is readable, engaging, and accessible, we hope to raise awareness about the importance of air quality. We hope that these can be used to encourage policymakers to make actionable change in their respective communities. 

By highlighting the relationship between air quality and population density, we hope to demonstrate the need for targeted policies that address the specific challenges faced by densely populated urban areas versus less so rural ones. This project will be of interest to a wide range of audiences, including those in local, regional, and state governments, urban planners, and the general public. It will provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between population density and air quality, and potential solutions to improve carbon emissions at each level. 


# Finding Data
The datasets for both Population Density and Carbon Emissions by State by Year were downloaded from web urls. The links to each dataset are provided below. 

https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/data/apportionment/apportionment.csv

https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions?end_year=2020&source=US&start_year=1990 

The dataset for Population Density was collected from the US Census which counts every resident in the United States by mandating that everyone fills out a survey answering a range of questions including the number of people in each home, race, sex, and age. The Census strives to make sure every person is accounted for. Therefore, this dataset is about accounting for every individual who lives in each state. The dataset for Carbon Emissions by State by Year was conducted by a range of datasources including Climate Watch, PIK PRIMAP-hist, UNFCCC, and GCP. The Climate Watch dataset is the most comprehensive because it includes all sectors and gases of each state for each year.

The Population Density dataset is comprised of 685 rows and the Carbon Emissions by State by Year dataset is made up of 50 rows. 

The Population Density dataset is comprised of 10 columns and the Carbon Emissions by State by Year dataset is made up of 18 columns.
