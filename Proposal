The dataset for Population Density was collected from the US Census which counts every resident in the United States by mandating that everyone fills out a survey answering a range of questions including the number of people in each home, race, sex, and age. The Census strives to make sure every person is accounted for. Therefore, this dataset is about accounting for every individual who lives in each state. The dataset for Carbon Emissions by State by Year was conducted by a range of datasources including Climate Watch, PIK PRIMAP-hist, UNFCCC, and GCP. The Climate Watch dataset is the most comprehensive because it includes all sectors and gases of each state for each year.
The Population Density dataset is comprised of 685 rows and the Carbon Emissions by State by Year dataset is made up of 50 rows. 
The Population Density dataset is comprised of 10 columns and the Carbon Emissions by State by Year dataset is made up of 18 columns.
